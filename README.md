Project Overview

Developed an end-to-end HR Analytics Dashboard to monitor workforce health, attrition risk, diversity, and organizational structure. The dashboard consolidates multi-year HR data into a single decision-support view for HR leadership, enabling proactive talent and capacity planning across departments and reporting managers.

Key Contributions & Insights

Analyzed 171 total employees, tracking active headcount (118), attrition (47), attrition rate (27%), and internal transfers (6).
Built headcount growth trend analysis (2020–2025) combining onboarding, attrition, and transfers to identify net workforce expansion and contraction periods.
Evaluated diversity mix (62% male, 38% female) to highlight gender imbalance risk areas for DEI initiatives.
Mapped workforce distribution by job level (Trainees, Professionals, Management, Contract) to assess talent pipeline maturity.
Identified department-wise headcount concentration, highlighting Operations and Sales as high-dependency functions.
Created manager-wise reporting funnel to detect uneven span of control and potential people-management bottlenecks.
Analyzed employee stability by tenure, revealing higher concentration in early (≤2 years) and long-tenured (5+ years) segments—indicating mixed retention dynamics.

Business Impact

Enabled HR leadership to pinpoint high-attrition exposure areas instead of relying on aggregate attrition numbers.
Supported workforce planning decisions by visualizing future headcount trends and role-level composition.
Provided actionable inputs for retention strategy, diversity planning, and managerial load balancing.
Replaced static HR reports with an interactive, slicer-driven dashboard, reducing manual reporting effort and turnaround time.
